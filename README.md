# Tic Tac Toe

This is a tic tac toe project for TOP. I tried to recreate a tic tac toe game in a browser using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

## After finishing the project

This project took me a while, sometimes I didn't understand the logic, sometimes code wouldn't work and I wouldn't know why. 

I used a help from youtube for this, because this project has a **large** amount of logical thinking. 

An *extremely* frustrating experience, I wouldn't be able to finish this without help from outside. 

## Pseudocode

No pseudocode was used here, because I forgot to make it.
